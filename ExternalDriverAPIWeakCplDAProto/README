README for External Driver API NUOPC for weakly coupled DA prototype
--------------------------------------------------------------------

A simple two model coupled system with a driver, layered with the nuopc-da
interface, allowing access by two DA components (for ATM and OCN).
The time step method implemented by the nuopc-da layer supports independent
time steps on different MPI ranks.
The nuopc-da interface is using the "External" Driver API to drive the coupled
system. Fields are connected between the coupled system and the DA components.

Description:

  A two-way coupled system with a single driver (ESM) and two model components
  (ATM, OCN).

  The ESM driver uses explicitly constructed petLists when adding the two
  model components.
  
  The ESM driver component uses the default run sequence to implement coupling
  between ATM and OCN components. 
  
  The application layer splits the MPI_COMM_WORLD communicator for ATM DA (lower
  half of ranks) and OCN DA (upper half of ranks). Both DA components access the
  coupled system through the nuopc-da interface layer.

Build:
  - Set environment variable ESMFMKFILE to point to the esmf.mk of your ESMF
    installation.
  - make
  
Execution:
  - Optionally set environment variable ESMF_RUNTIME_COMPLIANCECHECK to ON.
  - mpirun -np X ./esmApp (where X is the total number of PETs, typically 4)
  
Output:
  - PET*.Log files containing compliance checker output if turned on.
  - The prototype outputs time stepping information to stdout.

Code structure:
  - Makefile    - Makefile that is based on the standard esmf.mk mechanism.
  - atm.F90     - The ATM component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model.
  - ocn.F90     - The OCN component, specializing generic NUOPC_Model.
  - esm.F90     - The Earth System Model (ESM) component, specializing generic
                  NUOPC_Driver. Define partial petLists for ATM and OCN.
  - nuopc_da.F90- NUOPC-DA interface layer.
  - atmDA.F90   - ATM DA component on a subset of ranks.
  - ocnDA.F90   - OCN DA component on a subset of ranks.
  - externalApp.F90 - Application layer setting up the NUOPC-DA interface, and
                      both DA components.
